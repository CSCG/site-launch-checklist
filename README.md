# DataMade Site Launch Checklist
A checklist of miscellaneous tasks to do before launching a public website. To use this, make an issue in your project's issues called "Final Checklist" and copy and past the following:


```
## Framing / Call to Action
- [ ] Make sure that the site has a clear call to action. This should not be 'hey look at this cool tool'. Rather, it should be a way for someone to engage in a meaningful way on the issue being presented.

Some examples:

* Join a mailing list (which means you need to create one)
* Attend an event
* Share on Facebook/Twitter
* Donate to a particular organization
* Create a Tumblr for people to share interesting findings (if it's a data access site)

## Google Analytics

* [ ] Create [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) account
* [ ] Hook up the GA Tracking Code (typically in our `analytics_lib.js` file)
* [ ] Set up relevant Goals and Funnels
* [ ] Set up [Google Webmaster Tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home?hl=en)
* [ ] Verify site in Webmaster Tools with DNS TXT record
* [ ] Link Webmaster Tools to Google Analytics

## Sharing & Rich Snippets

- [ ] Set up general meta tags
 * <meta name=“description”>
 * <meta name=“author”>
- [ ] Set up Facebook meta tags & validate [here](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/)
 * <meta property=“og:site_name”>
 * <meta property=“og:title”>
 * <meta property=“og:type”>
 * <meta property=“og:description”>
 * <meta property=“og:url”>
 * <meta property=“og:image”>
- [ ] Set up Twitter meta tags & validate [here](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator)
 * <meta name=“twitter:card”>
 * <meta name=“twitter:site”>
 * <meta name=“twitter:creator”>
 * <meta name=“twitter:description”> (note that this needs to be under 200 characters)
 * <meta name=“twitter:title”>
 * <meta name=“twitter:url”>
 * <meta name=“twitter:image:src”>
- [ ] Create 2-5 meme images using [Canva](http://canva.com/) or a similar tool

## Outreach

- [ ] Write up press release
- [ ] Identify who will be the primary person of contact and make their info prominent on the website and all PR
- [ ] Identify relevant media contacts to email
- [ ] Identify relevant social news sites (reddit, listservs, slack channels)
- [ ] Divide & conquer - send out the media blitz!
```
