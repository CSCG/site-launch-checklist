# DataMade Site Launch Checklist
A checklist of miscellaneous tasks to do before launching a public website.

## Framing / Call to Action
Make sure that the site has a clear call to action. This should not be 'hey look at this cool tool'. Rather, it should be a way for someone to engage in a meaningful way on the issue being presented.

Some examples:

* Join a mailing list (which means you need to create one)
* Attend an event
* Share on Facebook/Twitter
* Donate to a particular organization
* Create a Tumblr for people to share interesting findings (if it's a data access site)

## Google Analytics

Copy the following into your projects repo's issues as something like "Tracking"

```
* [ ] Create [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) account
* [ ] Hook up the GA Tracking Code (typically in our `analytics_lib.js` file)
* [ ] Set up relevant Goals and Funnels
* [ ] Set up [Google Webmaster Tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home?hl=en)
* [ ] Verify site in Webmaster Tools with DNS TXT record
* [ ] Link Webmaster Tools to Google Analytics
```

## Sharing & Rich Snippets

Copy the following into your project's repo issues as an issue like "Sharing"

```
- [ ] Set up Twitter, Facebook and general meta tags with
 * title
 * URL
 * description
 * image
- [ ] Create 2-5 meme images using [Canva](http://canva.com/) or a similar tool
```

## Outreach

Copy the following into your project's repo issues as an issue like "Outreach"

```
- [ ] Write up press release
- [ ] Identify who will be the primary person of contact and make their info prominent on the website and all PR
- [ ] Identify relevant media contacts to email
- [ ] Identify relevant social news sites (reddit, listservs, slack channels)
- [ ] Divide & conquer - send out the media blitz!
```
