# DataMade Site Launch Checklist
A checklist of miscellaneous tasks to do before launching a public website.

## Framing / Call to Action
Make sure that the site has a clear call to action. This should not be 'hey look at this cool tool'. Rather, it should be a way for someone to engage in a meaningful way on the issue being presented.

Some examples:

* Join a mailing list (which means you need to create one)
* Attend an event
* Share on Facebook/Twitter
* Donate to a particular organization
* Create a Tumblr for people to share interesting findings (if it's a data access site)

## Google Analytics

1. Create [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) account
2. Hook up the GA Tracking Code (typically in our `analytics_lib.js` file)
3. Set up relevant Goals and Funnels
4. Set up [Google Webmaster Tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home?hl=en)
5. Verify site in Webmaster Tools with DNS TXT record
5. Link Webmaster Tools to Google Analytics

## Sharing & Rich Snippets

1. Set up Twitter, Facebook and general meta tags with
 * title
 * URL
 * description
 * image
2. Create 2-5 meme images using [Canva](http://canva.com/) or a similar tool

## Outreach

1. Write up press release
2. Identify who will be the primary person of contact and make their info prominent on the website and all PR
2. Identify relevant media contacts to email
3. Identify relevant social news sites (reddit, listservs, slack channels)
4. Divide & conquer - send out the media blitz!
